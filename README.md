# Enlist-Help
This is a tool I made initially to scrape from my university's Course Offerings site. In later versions, I plan to expand this to have a wide variety of other scraping-capabilities. In its current state, this tool solely runs in the command line. Any plans for a GUI will be done in much later versions.

This is written in JDK 12.0.1, using Apache NetBeans IDE 11.0. Dependencies used (so far) are Maven 2.4, Selenium-Java 2.44.0, and JSoup 1.12.1.
