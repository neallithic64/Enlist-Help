# Enlist-Help
This is a tool I made initially to scrape from my university's Course Offerings site. In later versions, I plan to expand this to have a wide variety of other scraping-capabilities.
In its current state, this tool solely runs in the command line. Any plans for a GUI will be done in much later versions.
